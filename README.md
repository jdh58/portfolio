# Personal Portfolio

This is my personal website that I'm hosting on GitHub Pages using my custom domain. It serves as a portfolio for my continued work in software development.

To-Do:

- Fix the form to actually submit responses to a form
- When I finish projects, add video previews and clicking images to bring up preview overlay
- Add an effect on the splash page
- Add a dark mode with a dope effect
